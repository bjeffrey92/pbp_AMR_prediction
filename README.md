# pbp_AMR_prediction
Research code for a project aimed at improving our understanding of the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae

This project was inspired by previous work (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5558719/) which established random forests as the gold standard ML approach for predicting penicillin resistance in _S. pneumoniae_. I am refining this approach by making it more easily interpretable and applicable across populations.
